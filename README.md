# VsProspectorInfo
A clientside only mod to save trees by not having to write down the values of your prospecting.
## Installation
Just drop the file into your mods folder. You just need this mod on the client, no serverside installation needed.

## Usage
After prospecting, the info will be displayed in the tooltip of the minimap when hovering over the chunk. This info is stored in %Vintage_Story_Data%/Mods/Data/YourWorldSeed/PospectorInfo.prospectorMessages.json and is client side only.
